Hi, I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Toronto in the Department of Computer science. My research focus is interdisciplinary combining 
techniques of Human Computer Interaction with critical theories from social sciences and feminist STS. 
My current research looks at the use and impact of data, digitization, and algorithms in developing countries (such as my home-country Nepal) in applications such as crisis informatics, disaster risk reduction, civic technologies, and climate adaptation.

### Research Interests:

- Information infrastructures in developing countries
- Critical and responsible AI
- Human Computer Interaction
- Feminist and Anti-colonial STS
